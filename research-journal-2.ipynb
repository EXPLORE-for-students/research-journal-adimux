    "## Describe at least one research activity you worked on this week.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implemented sound wave model for dark sector phase transitions using PTArcade\n",
    "- Fitted both decaying and stable dark sector models to NANOGrav 15yr data\n",
    "- Created visualization scripts for spectrum and posterior distribution analysis\n",
    "- Compared gravitational wave signals from different dark sector scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on last week's bubble wall model, this week focused on understanding sound wave contributions to the gravitational wave background from dark sector phase transitions. Phase transitions produce two types of GW sources: bubble wall collisions and sound wave radiation from plasma dynamics. The sound shell model is more realistic than the bubble wall model alone, as real phase transitions generate both sources. By fitting decaying and stable dark sector models separately, we can determine which scenario better explains any signal detected by NANOGrav."

    "# 2: What? (What happened?)\n",
    "## Describe what happened during your activities for the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "I began by studying the sound shell model equations from the LISA 2019 review and the thesis, which parameterizes gravitational wave spectra from sound waves during phase transitions. The key equation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h^2\\Omega_{sw}(f) = R h^2 \\tilde{\\Omega}_{sw} \\left(\\frac{\\kappa_{sw}\\alpha}{\\alpha + 1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{H}\\right)^{-1} y_{sh} s_{sw}(f/f_{p,sw})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with shape function $s_{sw}(x) = x^3 \\left(\\frac{7}{4+3x^2}\\right)^{7/2}$ and efficiency factor $y_{sh} = \\min[1, \\frac{3.38}{\\beta/H}\\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\alpha}{\\kappa_{sw}\\alpha}}]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Approach: Decaying Dark Sector\n",
    "\n",
    "I first created a sound wave model for a **decaying dark sector** (`model_soundwave.py`) with 5 parameters: α, β/H, T_p (GeV), ε_p, and τ_φ (decay timescale). After fitting this model to NANOGrav 15yr data, I obtained:\n",
    "\n",
    "- α = 0.202 (moderate phase transition strength)\n",
    "- β/H = 6.15 (satisfies β/H > 3 percolation requirement)\n",
    "- T_p = 4.3 × 10⁻⁴ GeV (very cold dark sector phase transition)\n",
    "- ε_p = 0.159 (≈16% efficiency for sound wave radiation)\n",
    "- τ_φ = 0.0198 seconds (dark sector decay timescale)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, **these fitted parameters did not match the predictions shown in the thesis plots**. The model's spectrum did not align with what the thesis expected from similar phase transition scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Meeting Discussion and Pivot to Stable Dark Sector\n",
    "\n",
    "During our meeting, we discussed why the decaying model results diverged from the thesis expectations. Key issues identified:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Ambiguity**: The paper is confusing about how to properly model a stable dark sector. The parameterization is unclear.\n",
    "2. **Too Many Parameters**: The decaying model has 5 free parameters (α, β/H, T_p, ε_p, τ_φ), making it difficult to directly compare with thesis predictions that may not include all these effects.\n",
    "3. **Parameter Relationships**: It's unclear how some parameters are related and whether certain combinations are physically meaningful.\n",
    "4. **Physics Clarity**: A stable dark sector (no decay) is simpler and more directly comparable to theoretical predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision**: We decided to focus on the **stable dark sector model** instead, which has only 4 parameters: α, β/H, T_p, and **ξ_p** (the temperature ratio T_dark/T_SM at percolation).\n",
    "\n",
    "### New Implementation: Stable Dark Sector Model\n",
    "\n",
    "I created a new model file (`model_soundwave_stable.py`) implementing the sound wave spectrum for a **stable (non-decaying) dark sector**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h^2\\Omega_{sw}(f) = R h^2 \\tilde{\\Omega}_{sw} \\left(\\frac{\\kappa_{sw}\\alpha}{\\alpha + 1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{H}\\right)^{-1} y_{sh} s_{sw}(f/f_p)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differences from Decaying Model:**\n",
    "- **4 parameters instead of 5**: Removes the decay timescale τ_φ\n",
    "- **ξ_p parameter**: Temperature ratio of dark sector to SM bath at percolation. Defined as ξ_p ≡ T_d,p / T_p\n",
    "- **Simpler physics**: No decay effects means the GW spectrum depends only on the phase transition dynamics, not on dark sector longevity\n",
    "- **Better alignment with theory**: Should more closely match thesis predictions since it focuses on core phase transition physics\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter ranges:\n",
    "- α: [10⁻³, 10¹] (phase transition strength)\n",
    "- β/H: [10⁰, 10³] (inverse duration)\n",
    "- T_p: [10⁻⁴, 10¹] GeV (temperature at percolation)\n",
    "- **ξ_p: [10⁻³, 10⁰]** (temperature ratio, cold DS regime favored)\n",
    "\n",
    "This simpler parameterization with ξ_p as a core physics parameter should provide clearer physical interpretation and better agreement with theoretical expectations."

    "While the decaying dark sector model successfully fit to NANOGrav data mathematically, the fitted parameters didn't align with theoretical expectations from the thesis. This revealed an important lesson:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fitting Parameters ≠ Physical Truth**: Just because a model can fit the data doesn't mean the fitted parameters represent realistic physics. The decaying model's parameter combinations may have been degenerate or inconsistent with the theoretical framework the thesis was built on.\n",

    "\n",
    "By attempting both the decaying and stable dark sector models, we learned several key things:\n",

    "2. **Parametrization is Critical**: The choice of parameters (ε_p vs ξ_p, for instance) changes how we interpret results. The temperature ratio ξ_p is more directly tied to dark sector properties than an abstract efficiency factor ε_p.\n",

    "3. **Stability of Physical Interpretation**: The stable dark sector model's 4 parameters directly correspond to core phase transition physics:\n",

    "   - T_p: Temperature scale\n",
    "   - ξ_p: Dark sector temperature (direct probe of dark sector properties)\n",
