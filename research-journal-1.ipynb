    "## Describe at least one research activity you worked on this week. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Installed conda and PTArcade package for gravitational wave analysis\n",
    "- Generated gravitational wave spectrum plots using the Bubble Wall model\n",
    "- Fitted the Bubble Wall model to NANOGrav pulsar timing array data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation:\n",
    "\n",
    "I am beginning research on detecting gravitational waves from cosmological phase transitions using pulsar timing array data. The Bubble Wall model describes gravitational waves produced by bubble collisions during first-order phase transitions in the early universe. This week's goal was to familiarize myself with the PTArcade software and fit the Bubble Wall model to NANOGrav data to determine if primordial gravitational waves from phase transitions could be detected in current observations."

    "## Describe what happened during your activities for the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "I began by installing the computational environment. Setting up conda and installing PTArcade initially presented challenges related to missing LaTeX dependencies needed for matplotlib plotting. After resolving these dependencies, I was able to successfully run PTArcade and generate visualization outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the [PTArcade documentation](https://andrea-mitridate.github.io/PTArcade/getting_started/), I generated diagnostic plots showing the gravitational wave strain energy density spectrum using the Bubble Wall model—which describes gravitational waves from bubble collisions during cosmological phase transitions in the early universe:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Gravitational Wave Spectrum](test.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The plots display the characteristic strain as a function of frequency, with the best-fit model shown in blue/red and credible regions (1σ and 2σ) shown in shaded areas. The peak frequency of approximately 1.88e-08 Hz (about 18.8 nanohertz) is consistent with the nanohertz range expected for pulsar timing array observations and represents where most of the gravitational wave power from bubble wall collisions would appear today.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then generated a comprehensive two-panel analysis plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Complete NANOGrav Spectrum Analysis](nanograv_spectrum_complete.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive plot shows both the log-log spectrum (left) and the semi-log amplitude spectrum (right), including both the 68% (1σ) and 95% (2σ) credible regions from the posterior distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I performed MCMC parameter fitting using PTArcade to extract the best-fit parameters for the Bubble Wall model when fitted to NANOGrav data. The fitting procedure successfully extracted model parameters including the strength parameter α = 0.490 (characterizing the phase transition energy release), the ratio β/H = 38.1 (characterizing the phase transition speed), and the peak frequency of 1.88e-08 Hz.\n"

    "## Describe your results\n",
    "\n",
    "I successfully completed the software installation and plot generation, demonstrating that PTArcade is properly configured for Bubble Wall model fitting. The analysis fitted a cosmological phase transition model to NANOGrav pulsar timing array data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key findings from the Bubble Wall model fit:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The extracted parameters are:\n",
    "- **Peak frequency:** $f_p = 1.88 \\times 10^{-8}$ Hz (18.8 nanohertz)\n",
    "- **Phase transition strength:** $\\alpha = 0.490$ (normalized latent heat to radiation energy ratio)\n",
    "- **Phase transition speed:** $\\beta/H = 38.1$ (nucleation rate to Hubble expansion ratio)\n",
    "\n",
    "These parameters describe a first-order phase transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shaded credible regions in the plots represent the posterior uncertainty from the MCMC analysis. The 68% (1σ) credible region shows the most likely range of parameters given the data, while the 95% (2σ) region represents broader uncertainty."

    "\n",
    "I partially achieved my intended goal: I successfully installed PTArcade and generated plots, but I did not reproduce the published NanoGrav results. The frequency discrepancy indicates I need more information about the correct configuration parameters and PTArcade settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next week's objectives:**\n",
    "1. Review the PTArcade documentation in detail, focusing on frequency units and model parameter specifications\n",
    "2. Compare my configuration with example scripts in the PTArcade repository to identify parameter mismatches\n",
    "3. Attempt to reproduce the NanoGrav plot again with corrected parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal for next week is to successfully generate a plot matching the triangle plot from the paper. Achieving this will validate my software setup and allow me to proceed confidently with original research tasks."
